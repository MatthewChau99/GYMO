# GYMO

Gymo is a student-made, innovative social network platform aiming to connect young people who love workout. We hope to build an online community for everyone who enjoys workout, want to give it a try or improve personal skills. Coaches, peers, workout plans, diet recipes… no matter what you are looking for about workout, we are more than happy to provide you with any information to achieve your goal. 

We gathered our thoughts among student body and noticed that it is especially difficult to meet workout needs during this current global pandemic. So we had this idea to build a social network app for workout lovers to connect with each other and share their thoughts momentarily. Small helper features are incorporated to better facilitate user’s workout plan including mini calorie calculator, body stats analysis etc. 

Gymo is aiming to motivate users to work out more by doing so with friends. We want to make workout a more enjoyable and convenient experience and empower the larger workout community. 

The one and only wish we have in building this app is to encourage more people to keep or start working out and stay healthy at this terrible time. We really do need each others’ support more than ever.
